# Building Xamarin.Forms Mobile Apps Using XAML 
<img src="https://github.com/danhermes/xamarin-xaml-book-examples/blob/master/XamarinBookCover.png" alt="cover" align="right" style="padding-left:5px"> The xamarin-xaml-book-examples GitHub project contains the complete code examples for the book entitled <i>Building Xamarin.Forms Mobile Apps Using XAML</i></a> by Dan Hermes and Dr. Nima Mazloumi, published by Apress.  
<br/>
<p><q>Xamarin.Forms has grown to be Xamarin’s most popular cross-platform offering. With Xamarin.Forms we allow developers to write their UI code once, and have it leverage the native controls everywhere. Many developers build Xamarin.Forms apps using XAML, which is what this book is about.</q>

Many thanks to Xamarin MVP Jason Awbrey and Alex Blount for their XAML contributions.
Thanks also to Glenn Stephens for his tech review!

<h2>What's In Here?</h2>
Leverage Xamarin.Forms to build iOS and Android apps using a single, cross-platform approach. This book is the XAML companion to the C# guide Xamarin Mobile Application Development. <br/>
You'll begin with an overview of Xamarin.Forms, then move on to an in-depth XAML (eXtensible Application Markup Language) primer covering syntax, namespaces, markup extensions, constructors, and the XAML standard. XAML gives us both the power of decoupled UI development and the direct use of Xamarin.Forms elements. This book explores the core of the Xamarin.Forms mobile app UI: using layouts and FrameLayouts to position controls and views to design and build screens, formatting your UI using resource dictionaries, styles, themes and CSS, then coding user interactions with behaviors, commands, and triggers. <br/>
You'll see how to use XAML to build sophisticated, robust cross-platform mobile apps and help your user get around your app using Xamarin.Forms navigation patterns. Building Xamarin.Forms Mobile Apps Using XAML explains how to bind UI to data models using data binding and using the MVVM pattern, and how to customize UI elements for each platform using industry-standard menus, effects, custom renderers, and native view declaration. <br/>

<h2>What Are These Chapters About?</h2>
Here is the chapter content: (no code examples in Chapter 1)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Chapter 2 - Building Mobile User Interfaces</b><br/>
A Xamarin.Forms primer and a comparison of Xamarin.Forms vs. Platform-specific approaches such as Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android. Covers Xamarin.Forms Pages, Layouts, and Views.
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 3 - UI Design Using Layouts</b><br/>
Layouts help us organize the positioning and formatting of controls, allowing us to structure and design the screens of our mobile app. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 4 - User Interaction Using Controls</b><br/>
Pickers, sliders, switches, and other mobile UI controls facilitate user interaction and data entry that is unique to the mobile user interface and differs from the PC/mouse interface, largely because of the use of gestures.
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 5 - Making a Scrollable List</b><br/>
Lists are one of the most powerful methods of data display and selection in mobile apps.
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 6 - Navigation </b><br/>
Navigation lets a user traverse an app, move from screen to screen, and access features. Hierarchical, modal, navigation drawers, drill-down lists, and other key patterns make up the core of mobile UI navigation. State management is the handling of data passed between screens as the user navigates through the app. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 7 - Data Access and  Data Binding</b><br/>
SQLite is the database of choice for many Xamarin developers. Store and retrieve data locally by using SQLite.NET or ADO.NET. Using Xamarin.Forms data binding, fuse UI elements to your data models. Use the MVVM pattern by binding to a view model. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 8 - Custom Renderers</b><br/>
Extend the stock Xamarin.Forms controls and take advantage of platform-specific UI feature sets while maintaining a cross-platform approach using custom renderers.
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 9 - Cross-platform Architecture</b><br/>
Architect your cross-platform application by managing platform-specific code. Project-level options in Xamarin include Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) and shared projects. Cross-platform coding techniques include conditional compilation, dependency injection (DI), and file linking.
<br/><br/>

<h2>What Is the Book About? </h2>
<br/>
Xamarin Mobile Application Development is a hands-on Xamarin.Forms primer and a cross-platform reference for building native Android, iOS, and Windows Phone apps using C# and .NET. This book explains how to use Xamarin.Forms, Xamarin.Android, and Xamarin.iOS to build business apps for your customers and consumer apps for Google Play and the iTunes App Store. 
<br/><br/>
Learn how to leverage Xamarin.Forms to optimize cross-platform development using the most common UI pages, layouts, views, controls, and UI patterns. Combine these with platform-specific UI to craft a visually stunning and highly interactive mobile user experience.
<br/><br/>
Explore solution-building techniques from starter-to-enterprise to help you decouple your functional layers, manage your platform-specific code, and share your cross-platform classes for code reuse, testability, and maintainability.
<br/><br/>
This comprehensive recipe and reference book, featuring over 200 C# code examples with downloadable C# and XAML, addresses one of the most important and vexing problems in the software industry today: How do we effectively design and develop cross-platform mobile applications?
<br/><br/>
