<p><q>Xamarin.Forms has grown to be Xamarinâ€™s most popular cross-platform offering. With Xamarin.Forms we allow developers to write their UI code once, and have it leverage the native controls everywhere. Many developers build Xamarin.Forms apps using XAML, which is what this book is about.</q> <br/><br/>

<h2>What Is the Book About? </h2>
Leverage Xamarin.Forms to build iOS and Android apps using a single, cross-platform approach. This book is the XAML companion to the C# guide Xamarin Mobile Application Development. <br/><br/>
You'll begin with an overview of Xamarin.Forms, then move on to an in-depth XAML (eXtensible Application Markup Language) primer covering syntax, namespaces, markup extensions, constructors, and the XAML standard. XAML gives us both the power of decoupled UI development and the direct use of Xamarin.Forms elements. This book explores the core of the Xamarin.Forms mobile app UI: using layouts and FrameLayouts to position controls and views to design and build screens, formatting your UI using resource dictionaries, styles, themes and CSS, then coding user interactions with behaviors, commands, and triggers. <br/><br/>
You'll see how to use XAML to build sophisticated, robust cross-platform mobile apps and help your user get around your app using Xamarin.Forms navigation patterns. Building Xamarin.Forms Mobile Apps Using XAML explains how to bind UI to data models using data binding and using the MVVM pattern, and how to customize UI elements for each platform using industry-standard menus, effects, custom renderers, and native view declaration. <br/><br/>

<h2>What Are These Chapters About?</h2>
Here is the chapter content: (no code examples in Chapter 1)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Chapter 2 - Building Mobile User Interfaces</b><br/>
A Xamarin.Forms primer and a comparison of Xamarin.Forms vs. Platform-specific approaches such as Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android. Covers Xamarin.Forms Pages, Layouts, and Views.
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 3 - UI Design Using Layouts</b><br/>
Layouts help us organize the positioning and formatting of controls, allowing us to structure and design the screens of our mobile app. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 4 - User Interaction Using Controls</b><br/>
Pickers, sliders, switches, and other mobile UI controls facilitate user interaction and data entry that is unique to the mobile user interface and differs from the PC/mouse interface, largely because of the use of gestures.
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 5 - Making a Scrollable List</b><br/>
Lists are one of the most powerful methods of data display and selection in mobile apps.
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 6 - Navigation </b><br/>
Navigation lets a user traverse an app, move from screen to screen, and access features. Hierarchical, modal, navigation drawers, drill-down lists, and other key patterns make up the core of mobile UI navigation. State management is the handling of data passed between screens as the user navigates through the app. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 7 - Data Access and  Data Binding</b><br/>
SQLite is the database of choice for many Xamarin developers. Store and retrieve data locally by using SQLite.NET or ADO.NET. Using Xamarin.Forms data binding, fuse UI elements to your data models. Use the MVVM pattern by binding to a view model. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 8 - Custom Renderers</b><br/>
Extend the stock Xamarin.Forms controls and take advantage of platform-specific UI feature sets while maintaining a cross-platform approach using custom renderers.
<br/><br/>
<b>Chapter 9 - Cross-platform Architecture</b><br/>
Architect your cross-platform application by managing platform-specific code. Project-level options in Xamarin include Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) and shared projects. Cross-platform coding techniques include conditional compilation, dependency injection (DI), and file linking.
<br/><br/>

This is book is for C# and ASP.NET developers, architects, and technical managers as well as many Android and iOS developers.
